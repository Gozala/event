Functional reactive style events. FRP comes down to one simple idea:
some values change over time, these time-varying values are usually called
`signals`. Signals can be expressed in terms `event`-s - a time-varying stream
of values that can occur at arbitrary times. These library provides an APIs
for making such event stream and for emitting new values in an imperative
style.
